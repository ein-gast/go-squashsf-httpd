# squashsf-httpd

HTTP server which serves static files directly from SquashFS archives without mounting/unpacking.


It's a wrapper around [CalebQ42/squashfs](https://github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs) and [diskfs/go-diskfs](https://github.com/diskfs/go-diskfs).

Example data is taken from [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree) project.

Work in progress.
